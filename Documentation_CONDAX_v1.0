*Introduction*

The underlying documentation describes the CONDAX (DATAX II CONVERTER)
module, a service, which transforms static and Point-of-Interest (POI)
data from the OICP data (version 2.3) format into DATEX II (version
3.2).

DATEX II is the electronic language used in Europe for the exchange of
traffic information and traffic data. The development of DATEX II was
initiated in the early 90s because of the need to exchange information
between traffic centers of motorway
operators.footnote:[https://www.datex2.eu/datex2/about]

OICPfootnote:[The OICP has been published under a Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) license and is
accessible at https://github.com/hubject/oicp] is (Open Intercharge
Protocol) is a de-facto standard in e-mobility being used by thousands
of Charge Point Operators (CPOs) and E-Mobility Service Providers (EMPs)
to exchange data through Hubject’s eRoaming hub, the Hubject Brokering
System (HBS).

In a first instance the CONDAX is a service provided by NOW GmbH /
Nationale Leitstelle Ladeinfrastruktur in cooperation with Hubject. It
allows market participants connected to the HBS, to transmit their data
to the Mobilitäts Daten Marktplatz (MDM) in DATEX II format through
their existing OICP connections. The CONDAX will take over the
conversion of beforementioned data and deliver it to the MDM. The MDM is
Germany’s marketplace for mobility data, operated by the Bundestanstalt
für Straßenwesen. The MDM is continuously working to make as much
mobility data as possible accessible, across different means of
transport, network elements and
actors.footnote:[https://www.datex2.eu/datex2/about[https://www.mdm-portal.de/about-mdm/?lang=en]]

. *Function*
[arabic]

The CONDAX effectively converts data from OICP to DATEX II data format,
within the boundaries of structural compatibility. The data converted
includes:

{sp} +

A) Static POI Data +

Static POI data contains a charging points permanent data set, including
parameters like its

* Operator (CPO)
* unique IDfootnote:[The EVSEID (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment)],
* geographic location
* street address
* type of charging infrastructure
* connectors
* opening hours
* supported payment methods

Changes to static POI data will be processed and forwarded to the MDM
once every 24 hours.footnote:[Please note, that only data originating
from charging infrastructure located in Germany will be automatically
transferred to the MDM.]

{sp} +

B) Dynamic POI Data +

Dynamic POI data describes the charging points state regarding
availability to an EV driver. Dynamic POI data will be transmitted every
10 minutes to the MDM.

2.1 Structural Difference between OICP and DATEX II

While there are only few content-related differences between OICP and
DATEX II (the later covers all information of the former), there are
some substantial structural differences. The OICP applies a charging
point-based structure, where the EVSEID of a charging point is the main
parameter to identify a possibility for an EV driver to charge their car
(‘bottom-up’ methodology). In consequence, that means, the charging
point is the leading data object, which must exist in the HBS. Whether
it belongs to a specific charging station or even a charging site is of
minor significant and seen as optional information (and therefore might
not be available for all charging points). +
 +
In contrast, DATEX II is applying a ‘top-down’ (multi-layered)
hierarchical structure when it comes to objects, which contain location
data. At the very top of that hierarchy sits a location site, which
possess one or charging stations, which possess one or more charging
points. +
 +
This raises the complexity, that where DATEX II might require a site or
a station, the OICP does not possess that data and a workaround must be
found how to deal with this problem. Theoretically two solutions present
themselves:

[upperalpha]
. {blank}
+
Try to cluster the charging points to stations and sites based on data
fields, which actually exist, e.g., geographical vicinity or street
address. Unfortunately, this is more of a hypothetical possibility as it
would lead to a lot of data inconsistencies and flawed clustering.

. {blank}
+

Create a site and station object in DATAX II format for every individual
charging point.

The CONDAX currently applies workaround B) as it less prone to error and
mirrors ‘lived’ market structures.

. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) +
[arabic]

* _How can I use CONDAX as a service?_ +
 +
CONDAX as service requires a working OICP connection to the Hubject’s
HBS as well as a valid CPO User Agreement and Eroaming
Agreement.footnote:[For more information, please visit
http://www.hubject.com/[hubject.com]]
* __Can I use the CONDAX, if I am not a Hubject customer? +
 +
__While you cannot use the CONDAX module as a service, you can use its
source code to build your own data converter and run it on your own
infrastructure. However, the prerequisite would be, that your POI data
is stored in the OICP data format.
* _How can I contribute to the further development of CONDAX?_ +
 +
If you have suggestions how to further develop or improve the CONDAX
service please issue a pull request through Github.
* _Can I make changes to the CONDAX? +
 +
The CONDAX service can only be changed through requests._ However, if
you are planning to use the CONDAX source code to build a conversion
layer of your own, you are free to make any changes as the CONDAX has
been published under a license, which allows for adaptations and
distribution of changes.
